# flutter_rpg

A mobile application built with Flutter that allows users to create, manage, and select RPG characters. With Firebase integration, characters are stored in a cloud-based database, where users can create new characters, view a list of available characters, select individual characters to see details, edit character information, and have changes reflected in real-time across all devices.
